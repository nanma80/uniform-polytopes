# Near-miss stick-and-ball model

Back in high school, I made a paper model of this (I don't have photos of the original model). 
![stick-and-ball model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nanma80/uniform-polytopes/master/output/omni_120/omni_120_faces_2.png "stick-and-ball model")
It's roughly a ball-and-stick model, where balls are truncated octahedra, and sticks are hexagonal prisms. This model is unique because it is not "valid". It's a near miss. A truncated octahedron provides an angle of 109.5 degrees ( arccos(-1/3) ). However, the pentagon requires an angle of 108 degrees. It misses by 1.5 degrees. On a paper model, it was bearly noticable, especially because I inserted the "sticks" into the holes of the balls. Essentially I forced the paper model to bend a bit.

Several years later, I found that what I had is part of the Omnitruncated 120-cell. See [Eusebeia's page](http://eusebeia.dyndns.org/4d/omni120cell) for pictures. The polyhedra fit together there because they bend to the 4th dimension. In Omnitruncated 120-cell, we start from a great rhombicosidodecahedron.

Then, we attach a truncated octahedron to each of its hexagonal face, and a hexagonal prism to each of its square face. If we don't bend to the 4th dimension, we see tiny gaps.

This is part of the center part of the "net" of the polytope. Then we bend these cells a little bit to the 4th dimension to fill the gaps.

In high school, when I bend the paper model to fit the parts together, I was simulating the 4th dimension.
